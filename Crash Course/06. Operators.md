# Python Operators
> Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
> Python divides the operators in the following groups:

* Arithmetic operators
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Logical operators
* Identity operators
* Membership operators
* Bitwise operators

# Python Arithmetic Operators
* Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

|Operator|	Name|	Example|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|+|	Addition|	x + y|
|-|	Subtraction|	x - y|
|*|	Multiplication|	x * y|
|/|	Division|	x / y|
|%|	Modulus|	x % y	|
|**|	Exponentiation|	x ** y|	 
|//|	Floor division|	x // y|

# Python Assignment Operators
* Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

|Operator|	Name|	Example|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|=	|x = 5	x = 5	|
|+=	|x += 3	|x = x + 3	|
|-=	|x -= 3	|x = x - 3	|
|*=|	x *= 3	|x = x * 3	|
|/=	|x /= 3	|x = x / 3	|
|%=	|x %= 3	|x = x % 3	|
|//=	|x //= 3|	x = x // 3|
|**=|	x **= 3|	x = x ** 3|
|&=	|x &= 3	|x = x & 3	|
||=|	x |= 3|	x = x | 3	|
|^=|	x ^= 3|	x = x ^ 3|
|>>=|	x >>= 3|	x = x >> 3|
|<<=|	x <<= 3|	x = x << 3|
