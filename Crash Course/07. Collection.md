# Python Collections (Arrays)
* There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

   * _*List*_ is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
   * _*Tuple*_ is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
   * _*Set*_ is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
   * _*Dictionary*_ is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
* When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.
