# Basic Operations
# Arithmetic operators on arrays apply elementwise. A new array is created and filled with the result.
>>>
>>> a = np.array( [20,30,40,50] )
>>> b = np.arange( 4 )
>>> b
array([0, 1, 2, 3])
>>> c = a-b
>>> c
array([20, 29, 38, 47])
>>> b**2
array([0, 1, 4, 9])
>>> 10*np.sin(a)
array([ 9.12945251, -9.88031624,  7.4511316 , -2.62374854])
>>> a<35
array([ True, True, False, False])



# Unlike in many matrix languages, the product operator * operates elementwise in NumPy arrays. 
# The matrix product can be performed using the @ operator (in python >=3.5) or the dot function or method:

>>>
>>> A = np.array( [[1,1],
...             [0,1]] )
>>> B = np.array( [[2,0],
...             [3,4]] )
>>> A * B                       # elementwise product
array([[2, 0],
       [0, 4]])
>>> A @ B                       # matrix product
array([[5, 4],
       [3, 4]])
>>> A.dot(B)                    # another matrix product
array([[5, 4],
       [3, 4]])


# Some operations, such as += and *=, act in place to modify an existing array rather than create a new one.

>>>
>>> a = np.ones((2,3), dtype=int)
>>> b = np.random.random((2,3))
>>> a *= 3
>>> a
array([[3, 3, 3],
       [3, 3, 3]])
>>> b += a
>>> b
array([[ 3.417022  ,  3.72032449,  3.00011437],
       [ 3.30233257,  3.14675589,  3.09233859]])
>>> a += b                  # b is not automatically converted to integer type
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
TypeError: Cannot cast ufunc add output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') with casting rule 'same_kind'


# When operating with arrays of different types, the type of the resulting array corresponds to the more general 
# or precise one (a behavior known as upcasting).

>>>
>>> a = np.ones(3, dtype=np.int32)
>>> b = np.linspace(0,pi,3)
>>> b.dtype.name
'float64'
>>> c = a+b
>>> c
array([ 1.        ,  2.57079633,  4.14159265])
>>> c.dtype.name
'float64'
>>> d = np.exp(c*1j)
>>> d
array([ 0.54030231+0.84147098j, -0.84147098+0.54030231j,
       -0.54030231-0.84147098j])
>>> d.dtype.name
'complex128'


# Many unary operations, such as computing the sum of all the elements in the array, 
# are implemented as methods of the ndarray class.
>>>
>>> a = np.random.random((2,3))
>>> a
array([[ 0.18626021,  0.34556073,  0.39676747],
       [ 0.53881673,  0.41919451,  0.6852195 ]])
>>> a.sum()
2.5718191614547998
>>> a.min()
0.1862602113776709
>>> a.max()
0.6852195003967595


# By default, these operations apply to the array as though it were a list of numbers, regardless of its shape. 
# However, by specifying the axis parameter you can apply an operation along the specified axis of an array:
>>>
>>> b = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
>>> b
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
       [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])
>>>
>>> b.sum(axis=0)                            # sum of each column
array([12, 15, 18, 21])
>>>
>>> b.min(axis=1)                            # min of each row
array([0, 4, 8])
>>>
>>> b.cumsum(axis=1)                         # cumulative sum along each row
array([[ 0,  1,  3,  6],
       [ 4,  9, 15, 22],
       [ 8, 17, 27, 38]])
