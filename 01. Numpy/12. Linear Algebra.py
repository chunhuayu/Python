Parameters:
    square matrix
Returns
    The eigenvalues, each repeated according to its multiplicity.
    The normalized (unit "length") eigenvectors, such that the
    column ``v[:,i]`` is the eigenvector corresponding to the
    eigenvalue ``w[i]`` .

# Tricks and Tips
# “Automatic” Reshaping
# To change the dimensions of an array, you can omit one of the sizes which will then be deduced automatically:

>>>
>>> a = np.arange(30)
>>> a.shape = 2,-1,3  # -1 means "whatever is needed"
>>> a.shape
(2, 5, 3)
>>> a
array([[[ 0,  1,  2],
        [ 3,  4,  5],
        [ 6,  7,  8],
        [ 9, 10, 11],
        [12, 13, 14]],
       [[15, 16, 17],
        [18, 19, 20],
        [21, 22, 23],
        [24, 25, 26],
        [27, 28, 29]]])

# Vector Stacking
# How do we construct a 2D array from a list of equally-sized row vectors? 
# In MATLAB this is quite easy: if x and y are two vectors of the same length you only need do m=[x;y]. 
# In NumPy this works via the functions column_stack, dstack, hstack and vstack, 
# depending on the dimension in which the stacking is to be done. For example:

x = np.arange(0,10,2)                     # x=([0,2,4,6,8])
y = np.arange(5)                          # y=([0,1,2,3,4])
m = np.vstack([x,y])                      # m=([[0,2,4,6,8],
                                          #     [0,1,2,3,4]])
xy = np.hstack([x,y])                     # xy =([0,2,4,6,8,0,1,2,3,4])


# The logic behind those functions in more than two dimensions can be strange.
