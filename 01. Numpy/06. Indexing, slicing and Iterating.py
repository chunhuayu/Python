# Indexing, Slicing and Iterating
# One-dimensional arrays can be indexed, sliced and iterated over, much like lists and other Python sequences.

>>>
>>> a = np.arange(10)**3
>>> a
array([  0,   1,   8,  27,  64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729])
>>> a[2]
8
>>> a[2:5]
array([ 8, 27, 64])
>>> a[:6:2] = -1000    # equivalent to a[0:6:2] = -1000; from start to position 6, exclusive, set every 2nd element to -1000
>>> a
array([-1000,     1, -1000,    27, -1000,   125,   216,   343,   512,   729])
>>> a[ : :-1]                                 # reversed a
array([  729,   512,   343,   216,   125, -1000,    27, -1000,     1, -1000])

Multidimensional arrays can have one index per axis. These indices are given in a tuple separated by commas:

>>>
>>> def f(x,y):
...     return 10*x+y
...
>>> b = np.fromfunction(f,(5,4),dtype=int)
>>> b
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
       [10, 11, 12, 13],
       [20, 21, 22, 23],
       [30, 31, 32, 33],
       [40, 41, 42, 43]])
>>> b[2,3]
23
>>> b[0:5, 1]                       # each row in the second column of b
array([ 1, 11, 21, 31, 41])
>>> b[ : ,1]                        # equivalent to the previous example
array([ 1, 11, 21, 31, 41])
>>> b[1:3, : ]                      # each column in the second and third row of b
array([[10, 11, 12, 13],
       [20, 21, 22, 23]])


# When fewer indices are provided than the number of axes, the missing indices are considered complete slices:

>>>
>>> b[-1]                                  # the last row. Equivalent to b[-1,:]
array([40, 41, 42, 43])


# The expression within brackets in b[i] is treated as an i followed by as many instances of : 
# as needed to represent the remaining axes. NumPy also allows you to write this using dots as b[i,...].

# The dots (...) represent as many colons as needed to produce a complete indexing tuple. 
# For example, if x is an array with 5 axes, then

x[1,2,...] is equivalent to x[1,2,:,:,:],
x[...,3] to x[:,:,:,:,3] and
x[4,...,5,:] to x[4,:,:,5,:].
>>>
>>> c = np.array( [[[  0,  1,  2],               # a 3D array (two stacked 2D arrays)
...                 [ 10, 12, 13]],
...                [[100,101,102],
...                 [110,112,113]]])
>>> c.shape
(2, 2, 3)
>>> c[1,...]                                   # same as c[1,:,:] or c[1]
array([[100, 101, 102],
       [110, 112, 113]])
>>> c[...,2]                                   # same as c[:,:,2]
array([[  2,  13],
       [102, 113]])


# Iterating over multidimensional arrays is done with respect to the first axis:

>>>
>>> for row in b:
...     print(row)
...
[0 1 2 3]
[10 11 12 13]
[20 21 22 23]
[30 31 32 33]
[40 41 42 43]


# However, if one wants to perform an operation on each element in the array, 
# one can use the flat attribute which is an iterator over all the elements of the array:
>>>
>>> for element in b.flat:
...     print(element)
