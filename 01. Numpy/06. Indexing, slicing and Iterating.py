# Indexing, Slicing and Iterating
# One-dimensional arrays can be indexed, sliced and iterated over, much like lists and other Python sequences.

# Another common use of indexing with arrays is the search of the maximum value of time-dependent series:
>>>
>>> time = np.linspace(20, 145, 5)                 # time scale
>>> data = np.sin(np.arange(20)).reshape(5,4)      # 4 time-dependent series

>>> data
array([[ 0.        ,  0.84147098,  0.90929743,  0.14112001],

       [-0.28790332, -0.96139749, -0.75098725,  0.14987721]])
>>>
>>> ind = data.argmax(axis=0)                  # index of the maxima for each series
>>> ind
array([2, 0, 3, 1])
>>>
>>> time_max = time[ind]                       # times corresponding to the maxima
>>>
>>> data_max = data[ind, range(data.shape[1])] # => data[ind[0],0], data[ind[1],1]...

array([  82.5 ,   20.  ,  113.75,   51.25])

array([ 0.98935825,  0.84147098,  0.99060736,  0.6569866 ])

# You can also use indexing with arrays as a target to assign to:
>>>
>>> a = np.arange(5)
>>> a
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
>>> a[[1,3,4]] = 0
>>> a
array([0, 0, 2, 0, 0])


# However, when the list of indices contains repetitions, the assignment is done several times, leaving behind the last value:
>>>
>>> a = np.arange(5)
>>> a[[0,0,2]]=[1,2,3]
>>> a
array([2, 1, 3, 3, 4])


# This is reasonable enough, but watch out if you want to use Python’s += construct, as it may not do what you expect:
>>>
>>> a = np.arange(5)
>>> a[[0,0,2]]+=1
>>> a
array([1, 1, 3, 3, 4])


# Even though 0 occurs twice in the list of indices, the 0th element is only incremented once. 
# This is because Python requires “a+=1” to be equivalent to “a = a + 1”.

# Indexing with Boolean Arrays
# When we index arrays with arrays of (integer) indices we are providing the list of indices to pick. 
# With boolean indices the approach is different; we explicitly choose which items in the array we want and which ones we don’t.
# The most natural way one can think of for boolean indexing is to use boolean arrays that have the same shape as the original array:

>>>
>>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
>>> b = a > 4
>>> b                                          # b is a boolean with a's shape
array([[False, False, False, False],
       [False,  True,  True,  True],
       [ True,  True,  True,  True]])
>>> a[b]                                       # 1d array with the selected elements
array([ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11])
This property can be very useful in assignments:

>>>
>>> a[b] = 0                                   # All elements of 'a' higher than 4 become 0
>>> a
array([[0, 1, 2, 3],
       [4, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0]])


# You can look at the following example to see how to use boolean indexing to generate an image of the Mandelbrot set:

>>>
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> def mandelbrot( h,w, maxit=20 ):
...     """Returns an image of the Mandelbrot fractal of size (h,w)."""
...     y,x = np.ogrid[ -1.4:1.4:h*1j, -2:0.8:w*1j ]
...     c = x+y*1j
...     z = c
...     divtime = maxit + np.zeros(z.shape, dtype=int)
...
...     for i in range(maxit):
...         z = z**2 + c
...         diverge = z*np.conj(z) > 2**2            # who is diverging
...         div_now = diverge & (divtime==maxit)  # who is diverging now
...         divtime[div_now] = i                  # note when
...         z[diverge] = 2                        # avoid diverging too much
...
...     return divtime
>>> plt.imshow(mandelbrot(400,400))
>>> plt.show()

# The second way of indexing with booleans is more similar to integer indexing; 
# for each dimension of the array we give a 1D boolean array selecting the slices we want:

>>>
>>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
>>> b1 = np.array([False,True,True])             # first dim selection
>>> b2 = np.array([True,False,True,False])       # second dim selection
>>>
>>> a[b1,:]                                   # selecting rows
array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])
>>>
>>> a[b1]                                     # same thing
array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])
>>>
>>> a[:,b2]                                   # selecting columns
array([[ 0,  2],
       [ 4,  6],
       [ 8, 10]])
>>>
>>> a[b1,b2]                                  # a weird thing to do
array([ 4, 10])



# Note that the length of the 1D boolean array must coincide with the length of the dimension (or axis) you want to slice.
# In the previous example, b1 has length 3 (the number of rows in a), and b2 (of length 4) is suitable to 
# index the 2nd axis (columns) of a.

# When fewer indices are provided than the number of axes, the missing indices are considered complete slices:

>>>
>>> b[-1]                                  # the last row. Equivalent to b[-1,:]
array([40, 41, 42, 43])


# The expression within brackets in b[i] is treated as an i followed by as many instances of : 
# as needed to represent the remaining axes. NumPy also allows you to write this using dots as b[i,...].

# The dots (...) represent as many colons as needed to produce a complete indexing tuple. 
# For example, if x is an array with 5 axes, then

x[1,2,...] is equivalent to x[1,2,:,:,:],
x[...,3] to x[:,:,:,:,3] and
x[4,...,5,:] to x[4,:,:,5,:].
>>>
>>> c = np.array( [[[  0,  1,  2],               # a 3D array (two stacked 2D arrays)
...                 [ 10, 12, 13]],
...                [[100,101,102],
...                 [110,112,113]]])
>>> c.shape
(2, 2, 3)
>>> c[1,...]                                   # same as c[1,:,:] or c[1]
array([[100, 101, 102],
       [110, 112, 113]])
>>> c[...,2]                                   # same as c[:,:,2]
array([[  2,  13],
       [102, 113]])


# Iterating over multidimensional arrays is done with respect to the first axis:

>>>
>>> for row in b:
...     print(row)
...
[0 1 2 3]
[10 11 12 13]
[20 21 22 23]
[30 31 32 33]
[40 41 42 43]


# However, if one wants to perform an operation on each element in the array, 
# one can use the flat attribute which is an iterator over all the elements of the array:
